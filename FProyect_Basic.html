   <div> We are a group of Mexican enthusiasts who are developing a way to extract cellulose from manure. Yes, you read that right. Manure!
         We are currently working on a unique methodology that does not involve toxic chemicals for the environment, but fungi. <BR> </BR>
         We have already developed our first prototype and are continuing our efforts to increase performance and take a pragmatic approach.
     </div>

     <h2> Why do we do what we do? </h2>

     <DIV> Time is precious, it almost seems that we never have enough. To be honest, we are not sure how the idea <em> popped </em> in our minds.
     But it did. Today we have raised $ 3,000 in seed capital thanks to the people who believed in us, and in a new generation of green business and circular economy. We can not lose more time. <strong> We need to act NOW. </strong> Scroll down to
know more. </DIV>

  <h2>What is cellulose?</h2>

          Cellulose is a very common organic compound in nature, as it is found in
          almost all organic matter, such as leaves, grass and
          <strong> tree bark. </strong> This compound is incredibly important to our
          daily life, as it has been used as
          <strong> <em> raw material </em> for the entire paper industry </strong>
          and its derivatives. Here is a picture of some of the many uses of
          paper around us. <br/>

    <h2>Problem behind cellulose</h2>
<div>
         The great environmental problem behind  cellulose is that 75% of all
        trees that are being cut down in the world are destined for the extraction of
         cellulose for the paper industry. We are talking about a lost of forest
         area at a speed of <strong> 30 football fields per minute </strong>. <br />

         This is huge and incredibly costly to the environment and the planet.
         Trees are the natural hero fighting global warming. </div>

      class="tree">
     
    <ul>
      <div><strong>These incredible beings are capable of:</strong> </div>
      <li> <strong>Absorbing</strong> carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</li>
      <li> <strong>Releasing</strong> 60% of the oxygen in the planet.</li>
      <li> <strong>Filtering</strong> the air and underground water.</li>
      <li><strong>Many</strong> other important things...</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        As you can see, we can not afford to continue consuming our forests with
        such unsustainable processes.
